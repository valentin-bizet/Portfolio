> **"Where code meets the circuit."**

Welcome to my digital headquarters. This portfolio is designed to break away from standard resume layouts, offering instead a **Mission Control Dashboard** experience. It reflects my dual passion for High-Performance IT Engineering and Motorsport.

## Concept & Features

This project serves as a showcase of my career path, combining a technical aesthetic with a smooth user experience.

### 1. Dark Telemetry Theme
A custom-built design system using a "Gunmetal & Neon Blue" palette, inspired by F1 pit wall monitors and cybersecurity terminals.

### 2. Dual-Channel Timeline (The "Alternance" Logic)
A unique timeline structure built to visualize **work-study programs**.
- **Synchronized View:** Displays Academic training (Left) and Field Deployment/Company experience (Right) side-by-side within the same time block.
- **Visual Flow:** Connected by a synchronization link (`⇄`) to symbolize the transfer of theory into practice.

### 3. Secure Vault (Credentials)
A dedicated section for certifications and diplomas.
- **Integrated PDF Viewer:** Documents open in a secure, custom-built modal overlay (iframe) directly on the page.
- **No distractions:** Toolbar and navigation panes are hidden for a clean reading experience.

### 4. Tactical Contact Interface
A terminal-styled contact form featuring a live "Radar Ping" animation to indicate the user's current base location.
